# Lean installation party

This is not going to be a regular lecture, but rather an online gathering whose purpose is to make sure that all course participants have successfully installed the software needed for the course.

## For the impatient

You may go ahead and installation of:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Lean 4](https://www.lean-lang.org)

You may follow [these instructions](https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

You will also need to work with `git`. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with [GitHub](https://github.com), possibly by following these [getting started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) instructions.

## For everyone else

Further instructions to be written here.
